# Initial implementation of StripeHelper

* adds a `StripeHelper` class
    - `isUSBankTransfer` - using the provided charge id, checks the stripe API to see if it is a US Bank Transfer type
    - `isPiUsBankTransfer` - similar method but doesn't derive a `pi_` if a `ch_` is provided (one less API call)
    - `getCustomersByEmail` - returns all customers associated with the provided email (limit is 10)
* preps for a public npm package
